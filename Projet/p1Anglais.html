        <!-- Description -->
        <p>I started this project in October 2023, only two months after starting University. My goal was to explore and understand the basics of video game design.</p>
        <p>Thanks to OpenClassrooms, Skilleos, and other resources on the internet, I learned the basics of Unity for over a month before starting my own project. I wasn’t presumptuous enough to think I could do everything and succeed at once. My goal for this first personal project was to understand how all of this worked in a more tangible way.</p>
        <p>As a limitation for the project, I only wanted to create character movements (using a controller or keyboard and mouse) that you would find in a platformer/2D game.</p>
        <p>So jumping, dashing, sprinting, double jumping, wall climbing, etc...</p>

        <!-- Skills List -->
        <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Basic learning of C#:</b> understanding the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and basic C# concepts (variables, loops, conditions, functions) applied to game development.</li>
            <li><b>Basic learning of Unity and using a game engine:</b> getting familiar with the Unity interface, organizing scenes, the object hierarchy, and navigating the editor.</li>
            <li><b>2D movement and physics:</b> using Unity components to handle basic movements (sideways movement, jumping) using Unity’s 2D physics systems.</li>
            <li><b>Collision handling:</b> implementing collision detection with game objects for basic interactions (walls, floors, platforms).</li>
            <li><b>Using Unity components:</b> manipulating components like RigidBody2D and Collider2D to apply movement and collision effects.</li>
        </ul>
